Build a Robust Backup Strategy with the Power of Automation

Every day you make sure that your SQL Server backup jobs complete successfully. You (hopefully) run regular integrity checks on your data, and have automated cleanup tasks so you don’t run out of space. What else can you be doing to ensure your SQL Server data is protected in the event of a disaster?

By automating critical tasks and streamlining complex processes, DBAs can reduce human error, accelerate recovery, and ensure the consistent application of best practices across all SQL Server instances. In this session, you’ll learn how to combine PowerShell along with SQL server scripts to create, test, and maintain a robust disaster recovery strategy—covering everything from automated backups and restore testing to backup monitoring and DR restore scripting. By the end, you’ll walk away with practical tactics to ensure business continuity when disasters strike.
